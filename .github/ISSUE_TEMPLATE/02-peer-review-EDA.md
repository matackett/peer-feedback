### Is the data cleaning and data wrangling process clearly described? This includes how the group handled missing data, created new variables, reduced the number of levels for categorical variables, etc.


### Do the visualizations follow the guidelines we've discussed in STA 210? This includes using plots that are appropriate for the data, having proper axis labels, titles, etc. 


### Are any tables and figures clear, effective, and informative? Are they neatly printed with a reasonable number of digits displayed? 


### Should any visualizations, figures, or tables be eliminated, or are there any new visualizations, tables, or figures that should be added?


### Are there any variables the group doesn't consider that could be useful for the analysis? For example, variables that are thrown out that could be used with some additional data cleaning. 

### Include any additional comments, questions, and suggestions on the exploratory data analysis.
